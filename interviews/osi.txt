Write a function to output a list of parsed values from the input. Include
all the support functions (ie link list) as well:

    Input:  1. Buffer that holds the input message
            2. Length of the message in bytes

    Output: Linked list that holds the parsed values. Each node
            should hold one of the following values:
                  Speed in km/h
                  Heading in degrees
                  Altitude in meters

    Return: 0       - if failed
            1       - if successful

    Platform: The application software will be running on the intel
              platform.

    Message format:

            Values are stored in Big Endian notation.

            Byte 1 - 2:  Message Header (0x0508)
            Byte 3 - 4:  Speed Value in m/s
            Byte 5 - 6:  Heading Value in degrees
            Byte 7 - 8:  Altitude Value in cm
            Byte 9 - 10: Checksum

            1. Checksum is a binary addition of bytes from 3 to 8
            2. Message header must be checked
            3. Speed, heading, altitude are all unsigned integers.
